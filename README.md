duck-out (UNFINISHED)
========

kind of like breakout, but duck-out.

written in javascript using HTML5 (canvas), and jQuery (for the mouse movements)

since it's my first javascript program (and first time using canvas), you'll see that I sort of used billmill.org's tutorial... but I'm adding a twist! No bricks. Just ducks.
